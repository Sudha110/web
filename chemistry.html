    <p>
        As per sources, from the next academic year, the students with either of the optional subjects will also be eligible for admission along with Physics and Mathematics as mandatory subjects.
      <br>  The optional subjects include- Biology, Chemistry, Biotechnology, Computer Science, Informatics Practice, Agriculture, Information Technology, Engineering Graphic and Business Studies.
        
     <br>   While most of the engineering colleges take admission on the basis of JEE (Main) conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), many states have their own admission process for engineering colleges.
        
      <br>  Presently, there are nearly 3,000 institutions that offer 13.2 lakh undergraduate degrees in engineering and technology. If the courses including design, architecture, planning and town planning are included, this number would double up.
