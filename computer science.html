   <p>
    The Department of Computer Science and Engineering, RGUKT Nuzvid campus was established in the year 2010. Since inception, the Department has maintained top standards in academics.

 

<br>Vision:

<br>To be among the nation's premier research and teaching institutions in Computer Science and Engineering.

 

<br>Mission:

<br>To create, share, and apply knowledge in the field of Computer Science, including in interdisciplinary areas that extend the scope of Computer Science and benefit humanity; to educate students to be successful, ethical and effective problem-solvers and life-long learners who will contribute positively to the economic well-being of the nation and who are prepared to tackle complex challenges facing the world.

 

<br>Some of the highlights of the Dept of CSE, RGUKT Nuzvid campus, AP:

 


<br>Our students are performing consistently in GATE Examinations and Engineering services Examinations every year and are getting good ranks. Some of the top ranks of the Department includes AIR 8, 37, 128, 160, 280 etc.,



<br>The Boards of Studies (BoS) of CSE Department includes India's top academicians from IITs, IIITs, NITs, etc., and Industry personnel.



<br>State-of-art laboratories with learning-by-doing pedagogy: Students shall be doing term projects and projects in most of the laboratory courses



<br>Long-term Internship model: RGUKT has provision of "one-year full internship" for students of Engineering final year, under this the student can completely work with Industry during his final year of Engineering. However, he/she needs to come to the campus to appear for End Semester Examinations.
