    <h1 style="text-align: center;">About The Chemical Department</h1>
    <p>The Department of Chemical Engineering in RGUKT-Nuzvid campus was established in the year 2010. Identifying its significance that Chemical engineering is indispensable to modern society, influencing diverse sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, energy, and materials. It drives innovation by designing sustainable processes, contributing to cleaner industries and environmental conservation. From developing life-saving pharmaceuticals to optimizing energy production, chemical engineers play a pivotal role in creating efficient processes and materials that impact our daily lives. Their expertise extends to water treatment, biotechnology, and addressing global challenges, showcasing the field's vital contribution to economic growth, technological advancement, and the well-being of our planet.

        <br>The graduated chemical engineers have many career options to choose – like placement in MNCs, industry, teaching, research or an admission into PG courses like M.Tech, M.S or MBA in India or countries like USA, U.K, Germany and Australia. A few of our graduates turn into entrepreneurs. The department continues to upgrade chemical engineering syllabus structure, experiments and infrastructure to keep abreast with latest developments in chemical engineering and allied fields.
        
        <br>The department has instituted Chemical Engineering Departmental Club of Innovative cell and Hobby cell to hone the skills of the students. Apart from regular class work, the students regularly update and develop through various co-curricular activities organized in the department like seminars, conferences, workshops, industrial visits, summer internship training and invited talks by eminent personalities like successful alumni, scientists and industrialists. The department has Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers (IIChE) students’ chapter, a professional body that was adjudged as Best Students’ Chapter in the country during the year 2001.
        
       <br> The department has highly energetic and enthusiastic staff with academic and research pursuit. They are involved in the institute level activities like Higher education cell, Competitive cell, Student Development Campus Activity cell and Student Mitra (Student body)</p>
