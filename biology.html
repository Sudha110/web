    <p>
        B.Tech in Biological Sciences and Bio-Engineering (BSBE) is an undergraduate course of 4 years and the course involves the application of concepts and methods of biology and other sciences. It is the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create products that are usable, tangible, and economically viable.

     <br>   The candidates who hold a minimum aggregate of 50% in 10+2 from any recognized board are eligible to apply for this course.
        
     <br>    The admission into the B.Tech course is based on the entrance test. The students are evaluated based on the national level entrance tests like JEE-Main, JEE-Advanced, etc.
        
     <br>    Some of the top colleges that offer B.Tech in Biological Sciences and Bio-Engineering are IIT Kanpur, IIT Guwahati, IIT Mandi, IIT Jodhpur, NIT Raipur, VIT Bhopal, etc. The average course fee of these institutes ranges between INR 80,000- INR 3 LPA.
        
     <br>    The course includes the study of basic sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), Mathematics, and engineering courses like Basic Electronics, Computing, Engineering Mechanics, Engineering Drawing, etc.
        
     <br>     After completion of the course the candidates are eligible to work in the industry of healthcare, pharmaceutical & healthcare manufacturing sectors, government agencies like drug department, state health department, etc.
        
     <br>    The graduates can also pursue higher studies after completion of the B.Tech program. They can go for M.Tech in Biological Science & Bio-engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Agro-Technology, Environmental Science & Engineering, Computational Bioengineering, etc.
        
     <br>    The top recruiters for such graduates are Biocon, IFGL Bioceramics Limited, Orbees Medical, Reliance Life Sciences, Dr. Reddyâ€™s Lab, Cipla, Jubilant Life Science, Torrent Pharma, etc.
        
     <br>    The average salary is expected to be around INR 4 LPA - INR 10 LPA.
